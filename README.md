# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here you will find various projects I have worked on, along with examples of my code.

# About Me

My name is Lina, I'm 24 years old, and I live in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Unfortunately, I don't have any experience in commercial development yet, but I'm not discouraged and I'm actively seeking an internship in Java development where I can showcase my potential. I have a bachelor's degree in software engineering, and I'm currently taking Java development courses at SkillBox.
